\begin{abstract}
	We investigated the modeling of complex dynamical systems using switching linear dynamical systems and recurrent switching linear dynamical systems. The literature shows that this method is able to estimate complex nonlinear dynamics, with an increase in performance by extending the SLDS to recurrent SLDS. The goal of this paper was to investigated if this model is able to capture the behavior of bifurcations effectively. We studied two systems with different bifurcations, Van der Pol oscillator with a Hopf bifurcation and a Bautin bifurcation with a generalized Hopf bifurcation. It was found that rSLDS was able to capture the different dynamics before and after the bifurcation. However, different models have to be trained for each parameter value. The model is not able to predict when a bifurcation is going to occur.
