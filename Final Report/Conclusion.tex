\section{Conclusion and discussion}


The method can be very successfully applied to systems with a periodic orbit or strange attractor and the goal is to find the dynamics of this orbit. We can remark that this method is very limited in its ability to give an estimation on linear estimation the global dynamics. Unlike the SINDY algorithm \cite{} it is currently not possible to learn from data from multiple trajectories. This makes the method limited in learning the global dynamics and showing where the boundaries of stability are especially the position of unstable fixed points and periodic orbits. This makes the method only applicable for initial conditions that lead to periodic or bounded trajectories. The extension of implementing the ability to handle multiple trajectories will enhance the range of problems this method can be applied to.
